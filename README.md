# Playing-Little-Go-using-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
This project plays the game of Little Go using the Alpha-Beta Minimax Algorithm. Little Go is the same as the traditional game of GO, but is played on a 5x5 board rather than a 19x19 board.

The game is run by a host program that takes in the move from player 1 and makes changes to the board. This new board is given to player 2 who makes their move and reports back to the host. This is illustrated above.
